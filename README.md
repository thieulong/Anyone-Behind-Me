**Note**: If you encounter a *Can't open camera by index* error, try to change the camera index base on your device's webcam index (Usually happends when you have another plug-in webcam)
  
Change the camera index (line 4) in *sleep_detection.py* file. If you have no idea what your camera index is, try to replace 0 with any number from 1 and going up.
  
You can minimize the tracking window while you're working. Stop the program by pressing the *ESC* button.
